# Solar Logger Project

## Purpose
I'm just starting some solar energy projects which includes building batteries and setting up some
solar panels for testing under real-life conditions.

## Equipment
I use a Victron MPPT charge controller and will be logging the amount of energy the panels produce.
The battery has a JUNTEK battery monitor to show charge and discharge activity.

Solar panels:

Solar tracker:

Battery:

Logging: Arduino Mega2560 with Adafruit Datalogger Shield

## Code
There are three files:
1. `VictronLogFinal.ino` Logging from just the Victron
2. `JuntekLogFinal.ino` Logging from just the JUNTEK Battery Monitor
3. `SolarLogFinal.ino` Logging from both at the same time

The code is heavily commented so check there for details.
